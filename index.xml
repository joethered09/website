      <title>Presentation: Understanding How the Decentralized Web Works</title>
      <link>https://datatogether.org/posts/05_dweb_primer/</link>

      <description>This presentation explores what happens when files are shared over peer-to-peer networks. Using Dat and IPFS, two of the leading peer-to-peer protocols, the slides give a beginner-friendly overview of how users connect to the network, add data, and access data - as well as what&#39;s happening behind the scenes.</description>

      <description>Our history Data Together launched in 2016 in the wake of the Data Rescue movement, as archivers organized into working groups to backup at-risk US federal government datasets.
Since then Data Together has evolved into new model for distributed, community-driven stewardship of data. This model shows how groups of people, companies, institutions, NGOs, and governments can use decentralized and peer-to-peer web infrastructure to access, discover, verify, and preserve data they care about.</description>
