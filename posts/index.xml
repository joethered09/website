      <description>Data Together is a community of people building a better future for data. We engage in a monthly Reading Group on themes relevant to information and ethics. Participants&amp;rsquo; backgrounds range decentralized web protocols, data archiving, ethical frameworks, and citizen science.
This reading group is something your own collective can do too! We encourage you to draw on our notes document template for this month&#39;s topic. The template lists readings, calls out themes, and suggests discussion questions.</description>

Using Dat and IPFS, two of the leading peer-to-peer protocols, the slides give a beginner-friendly overview of how users connect to the network, add data, and access data - as well as what&#39;s happening behind the scenes.</description>
